# FrontEnd
# React, Axios
Front-end of a GoStack Bootcamp project
This was an exercise from the Rocketseat GoStack's course, and the main goal was to implement, in a template of front-end,
the connection with the back-end (that was a template that I had to implement REST API requests),
to remove and add items in the back-end, and its titles from a list in the interface.
